 <br><h2>ORGANIZED</h2>
 <p>The organizing of information could be seen since humans began to write. Prior to that, history was passed down only through song and word.[citation needed] As can be seen with religion, books and spoken word, science (through journals and studies) organizing not only is history but also supports the communication of history. organizing involves coordinating and arranging people in order to meet up a set planned objective.
